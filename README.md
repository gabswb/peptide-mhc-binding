Peptides-MHC class I binding prediction.

This work aims to develop a classifier that can predict MHC class I - peptide presentation based on the HLA allele encoding of the MHC and the amino acid sequence of the peptide.

The dataset used is extracted from the training and evaluation data of NetMHCPan4.1, a framework developed in Reynisson et al., 2020, see [here](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCpan-4.1/).
